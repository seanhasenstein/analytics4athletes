          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>As a passionate student of the game, Phil Leibham saw the impact that sports analytics and statistical analysis brings to both an athlete and a teams performance. Coaches are always stressing the importance of outworking the competition, however without a smart plan this can lead to wasted time and energy.</p>
          <p>This is where Analytics4Athletes comes into play, with our help, athletes, coaches, trainers, etc. are given statistical breakdowns as to the areas of success and also areas that need work. This provides a clear path to move forward allowing you to not only work hard but also smart. Analytics4Athletes is here to help you excel to that next level and rise above your competition.</p>
