<p class="small-margin">Player Development provides a personalized statistical analysis of an athletes previous season of play. This is a great tool for trainers, coaches, etc. to help provide feedback for an athlete as they move into the offseason and prepare for next year.</p>
<p>Example Player Development sheet for a guard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The primary focus points are on 9 different areas on the floor.</li>
  <li>The breakdown of a player’s shooting ability covers quantities and percentages for assisted/non-assisted shots.</li>
  <li>Shots off zero dribbles to any number of dribbles before the shot.</li>
  <li>Shots at anytime in the shot clock.</li>
  <li>Contested/non-contested shots.</li>
  <li>Touches in the possession before the shots.</li>
  <li>Upon request, defensive stats can be analyzed and included in a Player Development sheet.</li>
  <li>Thru Player Development statistics you get the best opportunity to fully analyze an athlete, giving you the opportunity to create a specific plan for the athlete, and in the end helping them improve upon the areas where they need it the most.</li>
</ul>
